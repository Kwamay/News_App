# 📖 Countries of the world <a name="about-project"></a>

**World News** is a React mobile web application that allows users to check a list of metrics (numeric values) retrieved from a selected API called News, where you can get information about news source and blog in the last 2 years via News API.

The main use of News API is to search through every article published by over 80,000 news sources and blogs in the last 5 years. Think of us as Google News that you can interact with programmatically! News API is great as a data source for news tickers and other applications where you want to show your users live headlines. We track headlines in 7 categories across over 50 countries, and at over a hundred top publications and blogs, in near real time.

This project was created as part of the Microverse Full-Stack Web Development Program, which is a 12-month program that teaches students the skills they need to become full-stack web developers. The program includes training on a variety of programming tools, such as React, JSX, CSS, and JavaScript.

The webapp has been deployed to Netlify and is now available for you to try. Click the link below to visit the live demo.
